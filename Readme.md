# YouTube Trending Analyzer

## Project Overview
The **YouTube Trending Analyzer** is a web-based application that allows users to analyze trending YouTube videos based on region, category, and other attributes. It fetches trending videos using the YouTube Data API and provides an interactive user interface for analysis. This project consists of a backend implemented in Python (Flask) and a frontend developed using React with Tailwind CSS.

## Backend Overview

The backend of the application is built using Flask and handles the following responsibilities:

1. **Endpoints**:
   - `/api/trending`: Fetches trending videos based on the region and other parameters.
   - `/api/categories`: Fetches a mapping of YouTube video categories.

2. **Technologies Used**:
   - `Flask`: Serves the API endpoints.
   - `Google API Client`: Communicates with the YouTube Data API.
   - `dotenv`: Manages sensitive environment variables like API keys.
   - `Flask-CORS`: Enables cross-origin requests for seamless frontend-backend integration.

3. **Core Files**:
   - `app.py`: Contains the Flask app with defined routes and request handling.
   - `model.py`: Implements the functions to interact with the YouTube Data API and process data.

4. **Key Features**:
   - Fetches trending videos based on region (`regionCode`) and maximum results (`maxResults`).
   - Retrieves and processes video category mappings.

## Frontend Overview

The frontend is built using React with Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API and visualizing trending videos.

1. **Features**:
   - Input fields for API Key, region, and video preferences (e.g., category, definition).
   - A button to fetch trending videos and display them dynamically.
   - Video cards showing title, channel name, view count, and thumbnails.

2. **Technologies Used**:
   - `React`: Component-based UI development.
   - `Vite`: Fast build tool for React.
   - `Tailwind CSS`: Simplified and responsive styling.
   - `Axios`: API calls to the backend.

3. **Core Components**:
   - `Header`: Displays the title and logo.
   - `APIKeyInput`: Input field for entering and saving the YouTube Data API key.
   - `Settings`: Allows users to select video preferences such as region and category.
   - `TrendingVideos`: Displays a grid of trending videos fetched from the API.
   - `Footer`: Contains additional information or links.
